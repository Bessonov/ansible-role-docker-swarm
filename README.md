This role:
- Bootstrap a cluster
- Manage managers and workers

The execution is based on finite state machine and therefore this role can transform existing cluster in desired state. See caveats and test transformation before execution!


See [ansible docker role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/Bessonov/docker/) for docker installaton.

Requirements
------------

Ansible 2.3 and installed docker.

Caveats
-------

If manager nodes changes, at least one of them should be stay static for every playbook run. For example, to exchange manager-1 with manager-2:
1. Add manager-2 to managers
2. Run playbook
3. Remove manager-1 from managers
4. Run playbook

Demote or remove nodes with playbook:
1. Leave nodes in inventory (see the example below)
2. Run playbook
3. Now you can remove nodes which doesn't participate in cluster from inventory

Example Playbook
----------------

Install role globally with:

    ansible-galaxy install Bessonov.docker-swarm

or locally:

    ansible-galaxy install --roles-path roles Bessonov.docker-swarm

Inventory (you can select any names for the groups, `removed-nodes` is optional for new cluster):

    [managers]
    node-1
    node-2
    node-3

    [workers]
    node-1
    node-3
    node-4

    [removed-nodes]
    node-5
    node-6

Playbook:

    # gather facts about nodes which should be removed or demoted from existing cluster
    - hosts: removed-nodes:workers
      tasks: []

    # docker must be installed before
    # you can use any role for docker installation
    - hosts: managers:workers
      roles:
        - role: Bessonov.docker

    - hosts: managers
      # docker cli doesn't support concurrent access
      serial: 1
      roles:
        - role: Bessonov.docker-swarm
          swarm_worker_hosts: workers

          # optional: override default parameters, see `defaults/main.yml`
          swarm_cluster_bootstrap_parameters:
            --advertise-addr: enp0s8
